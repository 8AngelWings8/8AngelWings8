- 👋 Hi, I’m Sommer
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects on web development or anything related to it.
- 📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile.
- 📕 Last summer I participated in a week-long coding immersion program that was organized by the my current employer. For my final project, I built a game (via Scratch) that would assist kindergarten-age children in learning the vowels of the alphabet. A couple months after I completed that project, I decided that I wanted to pursue web design and development. When I am not fulfilling my role as an elementary school teacher or participating in my weekly Japanese class, I am learning the language of JavaScript. I hope to take Harvard University's CS50 course some day.
